# Game-Mario

I have used Pygame(Python game module) to develop the final stage of Mario game.
For starting the game you need to hit the space button.The up and down arrow keys makes the player move up and down respectively.The player can fire the fireballs using key '1'.You need to prevent yourself from getting hit by the fireballs from the dragon.
I have included a background music in my game.I have also given a provision for winning or losing the game.As soon the the fireball hits the dragon or the player or even if the player hits the cactus or bottom fire,the game ends.
I have made use of various inbuilt functions and libraries in Pygame like loading the background music, blit one object on the surface of another object, event handling like pressing or releasing of keys,the FPS(Frames per second) of the game,managing the positions and velocities of the player and the dragon and the speed of of the fireballs.
